# Ihtic Mictlan: Between Life & Death

A 3D co-op roguelike inspired by Aztec mythology, developed in Unity during an exchange semester at Tec de Monterrey (TecMX).

Built with a team of 10, the project focused on stylized combat, multiplayer gameplay, and a modular ability system using ScriptableObjects. I led technical design and programming, including networking, VFX, and combat logic.
